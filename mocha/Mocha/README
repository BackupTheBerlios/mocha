Due to a limitation with Template Haskell, if you are writing an
Objective-C class in Haskell using Mocha, the name of the methods
in the class must directly correspond to the Haskell function.
e.g. if you have a method named "Foo:withBar:", then the
corresponding Haskell function name must be "foo_withBar".
