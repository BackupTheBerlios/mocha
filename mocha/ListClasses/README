There are three targets which can be built from the Makefile:

* ListCocoaClasses
* ListFoundationClasses

  - These two Haskell programs FFI-import the functions in
    lookup_loaded_objc_classes.o to examine the Objective-C class hierarchy at
    run-time.  They only differ in what Objective-C frameworks are linked in to
    the final executable; ListCocoaClasses is linked against Cocoa, whereas
    ListFoundationClasses is only linked against Foundation.
    
* ClassListTemplateTest

  - This program uses Template Haskell to examine the Objective-C class
    hierarchy _during compilation_ by FFI-calling the functions in
    lookup_loaded_objc_classes.o.  As such, you should see no output when you
    _run_ the program, but you should see a whole bunch of output when you
    _compile_ it.

  - ClassListTemplateTest is not a default make target; you have to manually
    specify that you want it built by typing 'make ClassListTemplateTest'.
